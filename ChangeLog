	* DESCRIPTION (Version): changed it to 1.2.0

	* DESCRIPTION (Date): changed it to today's date, 2007-01-10

	* signalextraction-package.Rd: renamed this file to match the 
	  package name, and updated the contents to match the package 
	  name as well.

	* dfa.R: Added two new arguments, sb and pb for the stop band and 
	  the pass band. They have an effect on the transfer function. Made 
	  some changes to the argument list, i.e. there is now again only
	  one argument list with the new naming convention left.

	* check.R: changed this function such that it works with the new
	  argument list.

	* dfa.Rd: Some slight changes in the description of argument 
	  expweight, to make things easier to understand. Added a 
	  description for the two new arguments pb and sb.

	* plot.dfa.R: bug fix, still hat argli$dd in the code. And another one:
	  there were passages with x$yf, but correct is now x$xf.

	* fit.rda: re-saved this output object with current terminology
	  of the arguments.

	* fitted.dfa.R: bug fix, still had object$yf in the code, which needs
	  to be object$xf.


2007-03-08 Marcel Dettling <dem@zhwin.ch>

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): changed it to 2.0.0

	* DESCRIPTION (Date): changed it to today's date, 2007-03-08

	* NAMESPACE: Added export(outsamp), removed S3method(predict, dfa)

	* dfa.R: Various changes by Marc, unclear and undocumented what it 
	  all was. In any case, two new arguments have been added, limamp
	  and i2. Marcel then changed the order of the arguments, such that
	  they are in logical flow. This included altering the arguemnt list
	  and some subsequent changes. Moreover, renamend pb=lb and sb=ub
	  throughout the code. Changed the default values for pbd and limamp,
	  such that they match the recommendations in the tutorial.

	* idefi.R: Various changes by Marc, unclear and undocumented what
	  it all was. Marcel renamed pb=lb and sb=ub throughout.

	* check.R: Added a new check for tpfilter=TRUE, as well as checks
	  for the newly added arguments limamp and i2. 

	* funcret.R: Various changes by Marc, unclear and undocumented what
	  it all was. Some minor cosmetics by Marcel.

	* outsamp.R: This used to be predict.dfa(), but the name was changed
	  to outsamp(), since it is a filter routine, not a real prediction.

	* parret.R: Maybe some changes by Marc!?! Minor cosmetics by Marcel.

	* periodogram.R: Changes by Marc!?! Minor cosmetics by Marcel.

	* dfa.Rd: Made all the necessary changes to match the documentation 
	  with the changes in the code (main points new defaults to arguments, 
	  new arguments). 

	* outsamp.Rd: This used to be predict.dfa.Rd. Made the necessary 
	  adaptations for the new function name.

	* signalextraction-package.Rd: Changed the package version and the 
	  date. Everything else remained the same.

	* fit.rda: Re-saved the fit object that was obtained from the 
	  modified function with the (new) default call.

	* inst/doc: Added this directory and the vignette therein.
